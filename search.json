It is available for Windows 11 and recent versions of Windows 10.\nWSL2 provides a seamless integration between Windows and Linux environments, allowing users to execute native Linux commands and run Linux applications directly on a Windows machine. WSL2 is designed to be compatible with the Windows filesystem, allowing you to easily interact with your Windows files.\nThere are detailed instructions on how to install WSL on the Microsoft documentation page. But briefly:\nYou should now have access to a Ubuntu Linux terminal. This behaves very much like a regular Ubuntu server.",
